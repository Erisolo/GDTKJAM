  - Yes, even the Moriai will die.
  - As we were born, as we will die.
  - Clothos was first. Spinning cheerfully, she spun herself.
  - Lachesis was next. She measured exatcly how long she had.
  - Then, came I. Born alerady wrinkled, born of death herself.
  - And I will cut out thread when there's no other thread to cut.
  - When there's no one to be born, no one to live, no one else to die.
  - And such, it will be over.
  - But until then, Clothos' wheel will keep spinning, Lachesis scale weighting,
    and my scissors cutting.
