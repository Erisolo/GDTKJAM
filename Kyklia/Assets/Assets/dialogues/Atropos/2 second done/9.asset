  - Diokles enjoyed being a soldier.
  - He didn't like the fighting that much, but he enjoyed the long walks and spending
    time with his friends.
  - He told stories every night by the fire. And those stories are still with his
    companions.
  - No historian will ever know his name. But he was loved. And he was important.
  - My shears had trouble cutting such a thick and strong thread.
